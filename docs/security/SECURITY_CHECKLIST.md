# üîí TokenBot Security Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures secure deployment and operation of TokenBot smart contracts.

## üìã Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Code Review & Testing
- [ ] **All tests passing**: `npm test` shows 47/47 tests passing
- [ ] **Coverage verification**: `npm run test:coverage` shows >95% coverage
- [ ] **Linting clean**: `npm run lint` passes without errors
- [ ] **Gas analysis**: `npm run test:gas` shows reasonable gas costs
- [ ] **Manual code review**: All contract functions reviewed by 2+ developers

### Static Analysis
- [ ] **Slither analysis**: `slither contracts/` shows no critical issues
- [ ] **Custom security checks**: No hardcoded keys, console.log, or unsafe patterns
- [ ] **Dependency audit**: `npm audit` shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] **OpenZeppelin version**: Using latest stable OpenZeppelin contracts

### Network Preparation
- [ ] **Testnet deployment**: Successfully deployed and tested on testnet
- [ ] **RPC endpoints**: Reliable RPC providers configured
- [ ] **Block explorer**: Contract verification working on target network
- [ ] **Gas price strategy**: Appropriate gas settings for network conditions

## üîê Deployment Security Checklist

### Key Management

- [ ] **Gas estimation**: Sufficient ETH for deployment + buffer

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] **Contract verification**: Source code verified on block explorer
- [ ] **Parameter validation**: All constructor parameters correct
- [ ] **Owner verification**: Deployer address is correct owner
- [ ] **Token details**: Name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply match expectations
- [ ] **Initial state**: Contract in expected initial state (not paused, etc.)

## üõ°Ô∏è Operational Security Checklist

### Access Control

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Transaction monitoring**: Set up alerts for large transactions
- [ ] **Balance monitoring**: Track token holder distributions
- [ ] **Event monitoring**: Monitor contract events for anomalies
- [ ] **Bridge monitoring**: Track cross-chain bridge activity
- [ ] **Security feeds**: Subscribe to relevant security advisories

### Documentation
- [ ] **Deployment record**: Documented deployment transaction hash
- [ ] **Contract addresses**: All contract addresses recorded securely
- [ ] **Network details**: Chain ID, block explorer links documented
- [ ] **Emergency procedures**: Incident response plan accessible
- [ ] **Contact information**: Security team contacts updated

## üåâ Bridge Security Checklist

### L1 Deployment (Ethereum)
- [ ] **L1 contract deployed**: TokenBotL1 successfully deployed
- [ ] **L1 verification**: Contract verified on Etherscan
- [ ] **Bridge compatibility**: Compatible with Base native bridge
- [ ] **Withdrawal delays**: Understand 7-day withdrawal period
- [ ] **Bridge limits**: Aware of any deposit/withdrawal limits

### L2 Integration (Base)
- [ ] **Bridge registration**: Token registered with Base bridge (automatic)
- [ ] **L2 token verification**: L2 representation created correctly
- [ ] **Cross-chain testing**: Bridge functionality tested on testnet
- [ ] **Finality understanding**: L2‚ÜíL1 finality requirements clear
- [ ] **Emergency procedures**: Bridge pause/unpause procedures documented

## üö® Emergency Preparedness Checklist

### Incident Response
- [ ] **Emergency contacts**: 24/7 accessible team contacts
- [ ] **Communication channels**: Discord, Twitter, GitHub ready
- [ ] **Pause procedures**: Know how to pause contracts if needed
- [ ] **Investigation tools**: Access to blockchain explorers, analytics
- [ ] **Legal contacts**: Legal counsel contact information available

### Recovery Planning
- [ ] **Backup strategies**: Token recovery procedures documented
- [ ] **Owner succession**: Backup owners prepared and trained
- [ ] **Community communication**: Templates for security announcements
- [ ] **Partner notification**: Exchange/DeFi protocol contacts ready
- [ ] **Insurance evaluation**: Consider smart contract insurance

## üìä Post-Launch Monitoring Checklist

### Week 1
- [ ] **Daily monitoring**: Check for unusual activity daily
- [ ] **Community feedback**: Monitor social channels for issues
- [ ] **Bridge activity**: Verify bridge is working correctly
- [ ] **Gas costs**: Monitor transaction costs and optimize if needed
- [ ] **Exchange listings**: Coordinate with exchanges for listings

### Month 1
