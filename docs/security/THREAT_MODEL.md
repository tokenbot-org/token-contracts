## 🎭 Threat Categories

### 1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

#### T1.1: Reentrancy Attacks
**Likelihood**: 🟢 Low  
**Impact**: 🔴 High  
**Description**: Attacker calls back into contract during execution

**Attack Vector**:
```solidity
// Potential attack pattern (NOT present in TokenBot)
function maliciousFunction() external {
    tokenBot.transfer(attacker, amount);
    // Reentrancy call here could manipulate state
}
```

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Using OpenZeppelin's battle-tested contracts
- ✅ No external calls in critical functions
- ✅ Reentrancy guards where applicable
- ✅ Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern followed

#### T1.2: Integer Overflow/Underflow
**Likelihood**: 🟢 Low  
**Impact**: 🟡 Medium  
**Description**: Arithmetic operations exceed variable limits

**Attack Vector**:
```solidity
// NOT possible in Solidity 0.8+ (automatic overflow protection)
uint256 balance = type(uint256).max;
balance += 1; // Would overflow in older versions
```

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Using Solidity 0.8.20 with built-in overflow protection
- ✅ SafeMath not needed (automatic in 0.8+)
- ✅ All arithmetic operations checked by compiler

#### T1.3: Access Control Bypass
**Likelihood**: 🟡 Medium  
**Impact**: 🔴 High  
**Description**: Unauthorized access to restricted functions

**Attack Vectors**:

#### T2.2: Cross-Chain Replay Attacks
**Likelihood**: 🟢 Low  
**Impact**: 🟡 Medium  
**Description**: Transaction replayed on different chain

**Attack Vector**:
```javascript
// Attacker replays signature on different chain
const signature = await signer.signMessage(message);
// Same signature used on L1 and L2
```

**Mitigations**:
- ✅ Chain ID verification in signatures
